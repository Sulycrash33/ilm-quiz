/**
 * Fills empty hadith locales with model output.
 *
 * Invoked by hand. There is no cron entry and no trigger for this, on purpose:
 * `translate-questions` runs continuously because the question bank grows and
 * nobody should have to think about it, whereas this exists because the owner
 * asked for machine translation "just for testing sake" and said they would
 * say when to stop. Something that only runs when somebody runs it is a much
 * easier thing to stop than something that runs on a timer.
 *
 *   POST /functions/v1/translate-hadiths
 *   { "locale": "ha", "limit": 20 }
 *   { "locale": "ha", "reference": "bukhari:6469" }   // just this one
 *
 * ── What it is allowed to touch ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only (hadith, locale) pairs with no row at all. That is not enforced here —
 * it is enforced by `complete_hadith_translation`, which inserts with
 * `on conflict do nothing` and has no update statement to reach for. This
 * function could be rewritten carelessly tomorrow and still not be able to
 * overwrite a published edition. See migration 0065.
 *
 * ── The prompt, and the one thing it must not do ──────────────────────────
 * `translate-questions` guards against a mistranslation changing which answer
 * is correct, and can check its own output because the choice count and the
 * correct index are structural. Nothing of that kind exists here: a hadith is
 * prose, and a wrong translation is wrong in a way no database check can see.
 *
 * So the prompt carries the whole burden, and the instructions it leads with
 * are aimed at the specific failure that matters — a model *improving* a
 * narration. Do not smooth it, do not explain it, do not resolve what the
 * English left ambiguous, do not drop or add a clause. The reference number
 * never reaches the model at all: `complete_hadith_translation` copies the
 * attribution across from the English row, so there is no path by which a
 * paraphrased citation could attach a narration to the wrong number.
 *
 * ── Swapping the model out ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The owner intends to move to a paid translation API. Everything specific to
 * Gemini is in `translateOne` and the two environment reads above it; the
 * claim/write loop below knows nothing about the provider.
