/**
 * Translates queued questions into the app's five non-English locales.
 *
 * Invoked by `cron_run_translations` every two minutes, and only when the
 * queue has something in it. One batch per invocation; the cron tick is the
 * loop, so a run that dies takes one batch with it rather than a whole
 * backfill.
 *
 * Within a batch the rows are translated by a bounded pool of workers rather
 * than one at a time — see the note on it below. Throughput is now the product
 * of three dials that can all be turned without touching this file: the cron
 * cadence, the batch size in `cron_run_translations`, and TRANSLATE_CONCURRENCY
 * in this function's environment.
 *
 * ── Why this lives here and not on Vercel ─────────────────────────────────
 * A worker needs a privileged, non-interactive credential. Supabase injects
 * SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY into an edge function's environment; putting the
 * worker on Vercel would have meant copying that key into a second place, and
 * a service-role key in a web app's environment is a much larger blast radius
 * than one in the function that already runs as the database's owner.
 *
 * ── The prompt is the safety mechanism, and it is not the only one ────────
 * Translations publish without human review — the owner's decision, made
 * knowing the trade. So the model is told, in the strongest terms the format
 * allows, the two things that would make a question mis-grade: changing the
 * number of options, and rendering two distinct rulings with the same word.
 * `complete_translation` then checks both again in the database and refuses
 * the write if either happened. The prompt is a request; the check is the
 * guarantee.
 *
 * The choices array is translated *positionally*. `correct_choice_index`
 * points at a slot, not at a string, so option 3 must still be option 3 in
 * Hausa or a correct answer is graded wrong.

   * ── Why this is a pool and no longer a plain loop ────────────────────────

   * concurrent model calls is the fastest way to hit a rate limit. That is
   * true of an *unbounded* fan-out and it is why this is bounded rather than a
   * `Promise.all` over the batch.
   *
   * But sequential made the wall clock the ceiling. One translation measured
   * at roughly forty seconds, so a 110-second budget spent one at a time fits
   * two, maybe three — about 860 a day, and 26,100 of them is a month of
   * waiting for a backfill nobody can watch.
   *
   * A fixed number of workers drawing from one queue changes the arithmetic
   * without changing the risk profile: in-flight calls never exceed
   * TRANSLATE_CONCURRENCY no matter how large the batch grows, so the rate the
   * model sees is a number set here rather than a consequence of the batch
   * size.
   *
   * Started at six. The first real run at that setting showed 12 of 12 rows
   * rate-limited on nearly every two-minute tick — Gemini rejecting most of
   * the batch outright rather than the ~40s-per-call throttling this was
   * sized around, and the refund made that cheap enough to run for half an
   * hour before anyone noticed the throughput hadn't moved. Turned down to
   * two while the actual per-key quota is unknown; `console.error` above now
   * logs what the API says — including, since the quota detail was widened,
   * the `quotaId` that says whether the limit is per minute or per day — and
   * the honest way to raise this again is to read that, not to guess a second
   * number.
   *
   * And the failure mode is now cheap. A 429 releases the claim with its
   * attempt refunded, so pushing the rate too high costs throughput and
   * nothing else — the queue is exactly as it was, and the next tick tries
   * again. That is what makes the dial safe to turn.
