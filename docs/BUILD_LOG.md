## Five Pillars — 180 of 180 · complete, validator clean

Authored 2026-08-20. First category of the rebuild. **All nine tiers at 20.**

Validator clean on every check: no near-duplicate pair above 0.5 similarity, no correct
answer appearing more than twice, no opening stem appearing more than four times.

### Tier 8 was short at 10, then closed

Worth recording, because the recovery is the reusable part. Tier 8 asks where the schools
differ *and why*, and misattributing a position breaches the one hard condition in the
handoff. A first pass sourced only ten differences to a citable standard — a wrong fatwa
page on islamweb, then Wikimedia rate limiting — so the bucket was reported short at 10
rather than padded from memory.

It was then closed properly. **al-Jaziri's *al-Fiqh ala al-Madhahib al-Arbaa* is available
as plain text on archive.org**, 3.8 MB, Volume I being *Modes of Islamic Worship* — exactly
the volume covering the pillars:

```
https://archive.org/download/IslamicJurisprudenceAccordingToTheFourSunniSchoolsAlFiqhalaAlMadhahibAlArbaah/IslamicJurisprudenceAccordingToTheFourSunniSchoolsAlFiqhalaAlMadhahibAlArbaah_djvu.txt
```

Follow redirects, or resolve the host from `archive.org/metadata/<item>` first; a plain
request returns zero bytes. Scanning it for windows naming three or more schools yields 464
comparative passages. Eleven questions came out of it directly.

**It also corrected work already written.** A tier-8 question sourced from Wikipedia said the
intention in wudu is "a formal obligation" in Maliki, Shafii and Hanbali. al-Jaziri is
sharper: for the Hanbalis it is a *condition of validity*, for the Malikis and Shafiis a
*pillar*, and for the Hanafis an emulation of the Sunnah that is neither. That question was
deleted and replaced by two carrying the real distinction. **Prefer al-Jaziri over Wikipedia
for any school attribution.**

### Citations

Every citation checked against real source text before use, not recalled:

- 24 Qur'an verses through the quran.com API
- hadith through the fawazahmed0 corpus, with gradings where carried: Bukhari 8, 1405, 1447,
  1503, 1623, 1936; Muslim 874, 1570, 1572; Abu Dawud 59, 61, 171, 175, 408, 415, 494, 594;
  Nasai 2333; Tirmidhi 787
- Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 2:158 through the quran.com tafsir endpoint
- eleven tier-8 positions from al-Jaziri; four earlier ones remain Wikipedia-sourced and
  should be re-checked against al-Jaziri when convenient

Tier 8 remains the highest scholar-review priority in this category.

### Notes for review

- Tier 5 deliberately includes narrations graded **Daif** (Abu Dawud 408, 415, 594). Each is
  asked *about the grading*, never as the basis of a ruling, per the handoff.
- Abu Dawud 415 is used to teach that **Maqtu** marks a Successor's statement rather than a
  hadith of the Prophet.
- Tier 9 answers are framed as *the reasoning to apply*, not as settled rulings, because
  these are cases on which qualified scholars genuinely differ.
- All 180 rows are `review_status = 'ai_drafted'`. None is published.
