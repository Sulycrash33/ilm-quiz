/**
 * Narration reader checks.
 *
 * `splitNarration` decides what the hadith of the day says, on the front door
 * of the app, in six languages. It is one regex either side of a guard, which
 * is precisely the kind of code that looks obviously right and quietly eats a
 * sentence. Every fixture below is a real row from `hadith_translations` —
 * including the two that broke earlier drafts.
