 * Back and forward across the admin area.

 * The sidebar could reach every page but nothing could return to the previous
 * one, so working through a list — open a category, go back, open the next —
 * meant re-navigating from the sidebar every time.
 *
 * `router.back()` does nothing when the admin page is the first entry in the
 * history, which is exactly the case when it was opened in a new tab. The
 * dashboard link beside it is the escape hatch for that: it always goes
 * somewhere, and on the dashboard itself it is dropped rather than pointing at
 * the page you are already on.
