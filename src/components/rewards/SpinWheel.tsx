/**
 * The wheel, which until now was a button.
 *
 * The rewards screen had a heading that said "Free Spin", a paragraph that
 * described a spin, and a `<PremiumButton>` that made a server call and printed
 * a sentence. Nothing turned. A player was told they had won something without
 * ever being shown the thing they won it from, which is the weakest possible
 * version of the one moment on this screen that is meant to feel like a gift.
 *
 * ── The outcome is not decided here ───────────────────────────────────────
 * This component cannot pick a prize and does not try to. `spin_wheel_rpc`
 * chooses, awards and records the reward before this animation starts; the
 * wheel is handed the index it must stop on and its only job is to arrive
 * there. So what the player watches land under the pointer is, by
 * construction, the reward already written to their profile — there is no
 * second source of truth to drift from, and no way for a client that lies to
 * itself to pay out differently from the server.
 *
 * ── On spinning something in a children's Islamic app ─────────────────────
 * Migration 0008 took the randomness out of this wheel and out of the chests
 * on purpose, on loot-box grounds: paying a set price for an unknown return is
 * structurally gacha. Read that file before adding any randomness back.
 *
 * Nothing here reintroduces it. The prize is still a fixed function of the
 * date, the same for every player, and the spin costs nothing at all — there
 * is no payment, so there is no wager. What this adds is the reveal, not the
 * gamble: it is the wrapping paper on a gift already chosen, which is why the
 * wheel decelerates into a known answer rather than tumbling toward an unknown
 * one.
