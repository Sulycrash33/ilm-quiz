/**
 * The opening word on the home screen.
 *
 * This component existed and was **imported by the home page without ever
 * being rendered**, the same fault `StreakCounter` had on the same file. So the
 * app had a hadith card built, styled and translated, and nobody ever saw it.
 *
 * Given room here because it is the one part of the home screen that is not a
 * number: a page that opens with progress rings and streak counts is a
 * scoreboard, and this is meant to be a place of study. The quote is set in the
 * serif at quote size, the attribution sits under it as a `cite` rather than
 * being joined on with a dash, and the khatim runs behind it.
 *
 * ── On the word "daily" ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is now actually daily. The narration comes from the `hadiths` table and
 * is chosen by the date, so every player sees the same one on the same day —
 * the deterministic choice migration 0008 established for the rewards, for the
 * same reason: a rotation nobody can predict is not a calendar.
 *
 * ── On the fallback ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The card holds every locale of today's narration and picks one on render, so
 * changing language is instant and needs no network. A locale nobody has
 * entered text for falls back to English rather than blanking, which is the
 * same per-row fallback the question translations use: a partly translated
 * bank is a working bank.
 *
 * Hadith text is never machine-translated. `0047` sets out why at length: a
 * narration is a claim about what the Prophet ﷺ said, published translations
 * exist, and there would be nothing to check a model's output against. Text
 * arrives either from a published edition — Arabic, French and most of the
 * Indonesian were imported from one, see `import-hadith-editions` — or typed
 * by hand at `/admin/hadiths`. Never from a model.
 *
 * ── The narrator ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The chain is drawn above the quotation and the reference below it, and the
 * two are pulled apart by `splitNarration` at render rather than by an edit to
 * the table. That file has the whole argument; the short version is that the
 * rule against rewriting hadith text does not stop at machine translation, and
 * a heading that was flattened into the body by an importer is a presentation
 * fault, so it gets a presentation fix.
 *
 * Arabic needs nothing special here. `LanguageContext` writes `lang` and `dir`
 * onto the document element when the locale changes, so the quotation inherits
 * `lang="ar" dir="rtl"` and the serif renders right to left without this
 * component knowing about it. The explicit `lang`/`dir` below is for the
 * opposite case: English text showing inside a page that is set to something
 * else.
