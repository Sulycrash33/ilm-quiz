/**
 * The small gold burst on a correct answer.
 *
 * Each piece gets its own size, fall distance, sideways drift, spin and
 * duration, handed to CSS as custom properties. The previous version gave
 * every particle the same 8px circle and the same straight 100px drop, which
 * at twenty of them read as a glitch rather than a spark.
 *
 * Pieces are emitted from the upper half of the container and drift outwards,
 * so the burst appears to come from the answer the player just tapped rather
 * than raining on the whole screen.
 *
 * Nothing is rendered for a player who has asked for reduced motion. The
 * stylesheet also hides `.star-particle` under that media query, which is the
 * backstop; returning early here is what actually keeps the nodes out of the
 * document.
