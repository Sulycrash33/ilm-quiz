/**
 * The payoff burst on a won run.
 *
 * `react-confetti` has been a dependency of this project for its whole life
 * and was never once imported, which is why finishing a tier looked much like
 * failing one: the same card, with better numbers on it.
 *
 * Three decisions worth keeping:
 *
 * **The colours are the brand's, not the library's.** The default palette is
 * a primary-school rainbow and would have been the only place in the app
 * showing hues that appear in no token. These five are the gold, the cream and
 * the mint the rest of the interface is built from, so the celebration reads
 * as this app celebrating rather than a plugin firing.
 *
 * **It stops.** `recycle` is false and the piece count is finite, so the burst
 * falls once and is done in a few seconds. An infinite emitter behind a
 * summary screen is a battery drain on exactly the phones this game is played
 * on, and it turns a moment into wallpaper.
 *
 * **It is decoration, and it is honest about that.** `aria-hidden`, no pointer
 * events, and nothing is announced: the screen behind it already states the
 * result in text for anyone who cannot see this. A player who has asked for
 * reduced motion gets no confetti at all, which is why the whole component
 * returns null rather than rendering a still frame.
