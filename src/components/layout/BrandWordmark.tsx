/**
 * The wordmark, as it appears at the top of the home screen.
 *
 * What was there: the two words in Inter, semibold, with a left-to-right gold
 * gradient clipped to the text. The owner's verdict on it was "not fine at
 * all, boring", and the diagnosis is not really taste — three things were
 * actually wrong.
 *
 *   1. **It was set in the wrong face.** Every other place the brand appears —
 *      the opening screen, sign-up, sign-in, the password screens — sets it in
 *      Source Serif at display size. The home screen, the screen a player sees
 *      more often than all of those put together, was the one that did not,
 *      so the app's own name changed typeface when you signed in.
 *   2. **The mark was not on it.** `IlmHuntMark` and `IlmHuntGlyph` are drawn,
 *      committed and used on five routes. The home header had no mark of any
 *      kind, which is why it read as a heading rather than as a masthead.
 *   3. **Nothing moved.** A masthead does not need to move, but a gold one on
 *      a dark ground that is completely inert reads as flat paint, which is
 *      exactly the complaint.
 *
 * So: the serif, the brand's own star as the ornament, and a hairline that
 * fades out under the words — a rule that stops rather than a box that closes,
 * which is what stops a small lockup looking like a button.
 *
 * ── The motion, and its limits ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two CSS animations, both defined in `tailwind.config.ts`, both slow: gold
 * travelling through the letters over nine seconds, and the star breathing
 * over six and a half. The periods are deliberately coprime-ish so they drift
 * against each other instead of locking into one shared pulse, which is what
 * makes a decoration start looking like a progress indicator.
 *
 * Both carry `motion-reduce:animate-none`. That is not politeness — this is
 * a fixed header, in view for the whole session, and a player who has asked
 * their system for reduced motion has asked for exactly this to stop.
 *
 * No `framer-motion` here on purpose. Everything above is paint, so it belongs
 * to the compositor; wiring it to React state would re-render the top of the
 * most-visited screen in the app sixty times a second to animate a gradient.

export function BrandWordmark({ className = "" }: { className?: string }) {
  /*
   * The name does not wrap and does not truncate, at any width this app runs
   * at. Set at one size it did both: at 320px — an iPhone SE, the narrowest
   * width this project supports and tests at — the header is 320 minus its
   * padding, the avatar, the streak-and-coins pill and the sign-out button,
   * which leaves the wordmark about ninety pixels. At 21px the serif needs
   * ninety-five, so "ILM Hunt" broke over two lines inside a 64px fixed
   * header and pushed the rule out of the bar.
   *
   * Hence three sizes, stepped on arbitrary min-width variants rather than on
   * Tailwind's `sm`: `sm` is 640px, which no phone reaches in portrait, so a
   * `sm:` step here would have been desktop-only and the phone would have kept
   * the broken one. Same trap the greeting fell into; see `SalaamGreeting`.

            switched off. A masthead may shimmer; it may not appear to have

            `bg-[length:220%_100%]` is what makes the sheen possible: the
            gradient is painted more than twice the width of the text, so there
            is somewhere for it to slide to. At 100% it would have no travel
            and the animation would render as nothing at all. */}
