   * a streak, and the owner's reading of it was the only reasonable one: that
   * the number had come from nowhere, since all they had played was the daily
   * challenge. It had not — it was two of the five questions in that
   * challenge — but nothing on the card said five, so nothing on the card
   * could be checked. This line says it.
