/**
 * A number that counts up to its value instead of appearing at it.
 *
 * Numbers that snap into place read as data. Numbers that climb read as
 * something you earned — which is the whole difference between a dashboard and
 * a game. This is the cheapest piece of juice in the app: no layout change, no
 * new colour, and it makes XP, coins and streaks feel like they moved.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - It never animates on a value it has already shown. Re-running the climb on
 *   every re-render would turn a stable screen into a slot machine.
 * - It respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and renders the final value at once.
 *   Counting digits is exactly the kind of motion that setting exists for.
