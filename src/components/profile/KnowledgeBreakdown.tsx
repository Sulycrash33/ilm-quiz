/**
 * Where a seeker's knowledge sits, category by category.
 *
 * This is the "Category Performance" card, extracted and given the ordering the
 * Stitch design implies. The data was always drawn, contrary to a first reading
 * of this page: `categories` already fed two cards, one showing volume on the
 * overview tab and this one showing accuracy on statistics. So this replaces
 * the inline block rather than becoming a third rendering of the same numbers,
 * which is exactly the duplication this project has been clearing out.
 *
 * What it adds over the inline version it replaces:
 *
 *  - **Sorted by mastery**, so the list says something at a glance rather than
 *    arriving in whatever order the query returned.
 *  - **Capped**, because a seeker with twenty categories in play wants to know
 *    where they are strong, not to scroll a wall of bars. The weakest is kept
 *    on screen underneath regardless, because that is the one worth acting on.
 *
 * Percentages are correct answers over questions *attempted* in that category,
 * which is the only mastery figure available here: the count of published
 * questions per category is not part of `CategoryStat`, and inventing a
 * denominator would put a confident wrong number on the page.
