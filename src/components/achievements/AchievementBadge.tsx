 * One achievement as a hexagonal plate.
 *
 * The gallery used to draw all thirteen as identical cards in a flat grid, so
 * a legendary rank achievement and "answer one question" were the same size,
 * the same colour and the same weight. Rarity now does the work it was always
 * meant to: `RARITY_STYLES` has existed in `design-tokens.ts` since early on
 * with five tiers and, until now, no consumer anywhere in the app.
 *
 * A locked badge keeps its name and its shape and loses its colour. It is not
 * blurred or hidden: knowing what is out there is the thing that makes someone
 * go and get it, and the app has no secret achievements to hide.
