            The daily challenge card stood here, and the position is the point

            been done and this is the invitation to do something today, and the
            invitation goes first.

            What changed is where it leads. The daily challenge and the daily
            login reward were the same five questions on the same day, on two
            screens, under two names — and the login one sent the player to the
            category grid. They are one panel on the Rewards Center now, so the
            front door points there: same slot, same invitation, one
            destination. That also retires the `/rewards` tile from the Explore
            grid below, which was the app's only other link to the page. */}

        {/* The player's whole journey, in one band.

            This used to be "Today's progress": a ring filling toward ten
            questions a day, reset every midnight. Two things were wrong with
            it. It threw away everything the player had ever done at the moment
            they most wanted to see it — open the app on a new day and the front
            door says 0%, having forgotten a month of study. And ten a day was a
            goal nobody had agreed to; missing it read as failure for a person
            who answered nine.

            ── Why the ring shows levels and not rank ────────────────────────
            It showed rank, and the owner's objection to that was exact: *"I
            answered just five questions, that is a separate entity entirely to
            my progress in a game that has categories I haven't even opened,
            and I am at 31%."*

            Right twice over. The ladder was mis-scaled by a factor of six —
            the ninth and highest rank arrived at about 16% of the bank, fixed
            in migration 0062 — and even scaled correctly, a points total has
            nothing to say about twenty-nine untouched subjects. A study app's
            front door should measure the study.

            So it shows **levels cleared**: one tier of one category, cleared
            when every published question in it has been answered correctly.
            That is not a new rule invented for this ring; it is the one
            `getCategoryLevels` already uses to unlock the next level, read in
            one query by `levels_progress()` so the two cannot disagree.

            ── The denominator, which this project has a rule about ──────────
            "Never state the size of the question bank" still stands, and this
            does not break it: the denominator is **levels**, not questions.
            The same paragraph that forbids the bank size explicitly permits
            the subject count, because it says how wide the app is rather than
            where it stops — and a level count is the shape of the journey. It
            is also the only honest way to answer "categories I haven't even
            opened", which is what was asked for.

            The rank has not disappeared: it is the title beside the player's
            name at the top of this screen, which is what a rank is for.

            ── Why the two numbers beside it are gone ───────────────────────
            "Questions answered" and "Accuracy" used to sit here, lifetime and
            unbounded. The owner's objection, looking at a card headed
            *Overall Progress* that read **0 of 261 levels cleared, 0%** with
            **67%** printed inches away: *"it's not specifying, that's why it
            shouldn't be there."*

            Both numbers were true. 67% was six of nine first answers correct.
            The problem was that nothing on the card said so, and the five
            questions of the daily challenge — a thing deliberately separate
            from the categories — were feeding a figure sitting under a heading
            about category progress. Two percentages side by side meaning
            different things, one of them unlabelled, is not a stat; it is a
            reader's puzzle.

            They are not lost. Both live on `/profile`, under headings that
            say what they measure. Here the card now says one thing: how much
            of the journey has been cleared. */}

            Continue learning duplicated the Learning tab in the bottom bar,

            a cold start it read "Pick a category", which is precisely what the
            tab already says, so the front door offered the same door twice.

            The daily mission — "Answer 5 questions" — was the harder call. It
            was not redundant, it was misplaced: it stated a task with no
            reward attached to it on the screen, while the reward it should
            have been attached to sat further down paying out for nothing. The
            two are now one thing, on `/rewards`: the questions are the price

      {/* The home screen used to render its own copy of the bottom navigation
          here, on top of the one `(app)/layout.tsx` already draws for every
          page inside it. Two fixed nav bars, stacked, on the most visited
          screen in the app — visible in a browser as the tab row printed
          twice, and a second full-width fixed element the phone had to
          composite on every scroll.

          They had drifted, too, which is the part that matters: this copy
          linked Rankings to `/leaderboard` and Shop to `/store` with its own
          icons and its own active state, while the layout's copy kept its own.
          Two navigations for one app is two places to add the next tab to, and
          only one of them would have been remembered. */}
