/**
 * Sound and vibration setup, shown once between signing up and the explainer.
 *
 * ── Why the screen exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Sound is off by default and stays off until somebody says otherwise, for
 * the reasons written at the top of `sound.ts`. The consequence was that the
 * only way to turn it on was to find the profile, which almost nobody does
 * before their first run — so the sound system that had been carefully
 * designed was, for a new player, simply absent. A compact toggle was dropped
 * into the corner of each onboarding screen as a stopgap. A corner icon is
 * not an invitation; this is.
 *
 * ── Why here in the flow ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Straight after the language choice, before the three profile steps. It was
 * briefly placed after signup instead; this is earlier, and earlier is
 * better for one concrete reason. An AudioContext may not start outside a
 * user gesture, so the tap that switches sound on is also the tap that opens
 * the audio device. Doing that at the top of onboarding means every screen
 * after it can make a sound; doing it at the end meant most of onboarding was
 * silent whatever the player had chosen.
 *
 * It sits outside the "Step N of 3" numbering on purpose. Age, avatar and
 * name build a profile; this sets two device preferences that are not stored
 * on the account at all. Counting it as a fourth step would promise the
 * player their answers here follow them to another phone, and they do not.
 *
 * ── Why the previews ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A volume slider with nothing to play is a guess. Every cue the game will
 * actually fire at a player is here to be tapped, so the level they choose is
 * one they chose by listening. The failure cue is deliberately not among them:
 * it exists, it is soft by design, and a screen before the first question is
 * not the place to rehearse getting something wrong.
