   * The tab icon was still the Next.js starter favicon shipped with the
   * scaffold, so the browser showed the old mark long after the logo was
   * redrawn. All of these now render the crescent-and-star glyph — the same
   * one as `IlmHuntGlyph`, which exists precisely because the full mihrab mark
   * turns to mush below about 32px.
   *
   * Next resolves `src/app/icon.svg`, `apple-icon.png` and `favicon.ico` by
   * filename, but they are declared here as well so the order is explicit:
   * the SVG is preferred where supported and scales to any size, with the .ico
   * as the fallback for browsers that request /favicon.ico directly and ignore
   * the link tags.
   *
   * The Apple touch icon is deliberately square-cornered. iOS applies its own
   * rounded mask, so a pre-rounded image gets its corners clipped twice.
