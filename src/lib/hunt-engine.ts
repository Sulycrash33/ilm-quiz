/**
 * The Hunt engine.
 *
 * A "hunt" is one run through a category: a fixed-length ladder of questions
 * whose difficulty adapts to how the seeker is actually doing, scored with a
 * combo multiplier and a speed bonus, and ended by either finishing the ladder
 * or running out of lives.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure — no React, no Supabase, no `Date.now()`.
 * Every function takes the state it needs and returns new state, so the whole
 * run loop can be exercised without a browser or a database. The UI layer owns
 * the clock; the server still owns grading and the XP that actually lands on a
 * profile (see `submit_quiz_answer`). What the engine computes is the *run*:
 * which question comes next, what the combo is worth, and how the run ended.
