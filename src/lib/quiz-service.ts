   * `questions.language` has existed since the first migration and nothing
   * has ever read it, so a player who picked Hausa has always been served
   * English. The obvious repair — Hausa rows in `questions` — was a trap:
   * nothing scopes a query by language, so those rows would have doubled the
   * bank for every player and broken the twenty-per-tier assumption
   * `buildTierLadder` rests on. Migration 0044 keys translations on
   * `(question_id, locale)` instead, so the bank stays exactly 5,220
   * questions and a translation is a different *rendering* of one, never an
   * extra one.
   *
   * ── The fallback is per question, not per language ──────────────────────
   * A locale with three translated questions out of twenty shows those three
   * in Hausa and the rest in English, rather than the whole run reverting.
   * A partly translated bank is therefore a working bank, which is what makes
   * it safe to publish translations as they arrive instead of all at once.
   *
   * `explanation` is not fetched here and could not be: migration 0044 grants
   * `authenticated` only the columns a player needs before answering. The
   * translated explanation arrives from `submit_quiz_answer`, after the
   * answer, in the same language.
