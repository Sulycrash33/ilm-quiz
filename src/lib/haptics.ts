/**
 * The game's touch.
 *
 * This is the third feedback channel, alongside colour and sound. It exists
 * because the two that were already here both fail in the situation this app
 * is most often used in: a phone, in a pocket-sized moment, with the ringer
 * off. Sound is off by default and deliberately so (see `sound.ts`); colour
 * needs the eye to already be on the thing that changed. A short vibration
 * needs neither.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately is not ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no vibration on a wrong answer that is longer or harsher than the
 * one for a right answer. A buzz is felt before it is interpreted, and a
 * punishing one on a learning app teaches the hand to dread the screen. Wrong
 * gets a single soft tap that says "registered", not "bad".
 *
 * ── On support ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `navigator.vibrate` is Android and desktop Chrome. **iOS Safari does not
 * implement it at all**, and no amount of feature detection changes that, so
 * roughly half the audience will never feel any of this. That is the honest
 * position and the reason haptics are an enhancement layered on top of the
 * existing colour and sound feedback rather than a replacement for any of it:
 * every cue here has a visible counterpart that already works everywhere.
 *
 * ── On defaults ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Unlike sound, haptics default to ON. A vibration is private: it does not
 * carry to the person sitting beside you on a bus, which is the whole reason
 * sound defaults off. It is still switchable, and it is switched off
 * automatically for anyone who has asked their device to reduce motion, since
 * the same setting is what people with vestibular and sensory sensitivities
 * reach for.
